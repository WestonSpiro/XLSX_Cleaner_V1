# XLSX_Cleaner_V1
Remove unwanted characters from your XLSX files!

Removes all characters except 0-9 a-z A-Z + - $ % . = , from XLSX files.

Single quotes & double quotes (' & ") cannot be removed yet - this will be rectified in V1.1

Written with Python 3

Simply upload your file and let the XLSX_Cleaner do the rest

The program does not change the uploaded csv file in any way.

A new csv file is created named the first three letters of the original file followed by an underscore followed by cleaned.

This program will remove any/all characters that are not used in financial transactions.

Version 2 incorporates a GUI for easy file cleaning.
